Setup Phase:

The game will prompt the player for a number of ships to play with, between 1 and 6. (Who picks the number?)
Then it will create that many ship objects and store them in an array.
Each player chooses vertical or horizontal for each ship and then places it on the board. (Does the player get to choose the order they place them?)
An error is then thrown if the placement violates the rules and an error message is shown on screen.
Once all are successfully placed, the game enters the play state.

Play Phase:

Turns cycle between both players and end when a shot is declared.
Each square in the player's grid is either empty if it contains nothing or has a "#" if a ship is located there.
Once a ship is hit on the player grid, it changes somehow.
The enemy grid is empty but changes to either an "X" on a hit or an "O" on a miss and displays a corresponding message.
When a ship is sunk, a message displays and all the hit markers change somehow.

End Phase

When every ship on a board is sunk, the opposing player wins and both players get corresponding messages. (Is there an "end of game" menu?)
The game is then reset to the start by deleting arrays and objects as well as changing the text values to their defaults.
